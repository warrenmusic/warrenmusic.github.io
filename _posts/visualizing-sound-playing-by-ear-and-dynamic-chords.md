Visualizing Sound: Playing By Ear and Dynamic Chords

For many of us, visual learning comes easier than auditory. This is why tabs and tutorials flourish on the internet as the predominant forms of learning songs on the guitar.

But music, in its essence, is an auditory pursuit. So that naturally means that we should turn out the lights, turn our computers off and throw them in the trash, and NEVER, EVER look at the fretboard, right...?

This is obviously a joke. But where does visual learning fit in our musicianship journey? When the emphasis is on growing our ear and our understanding of music in pursuit of musicianship, does visual learning have a place?

It absolutely does, even to an absolute ear-training purist.

Rather than shout, "la-la-la-la-la" when people try to tell us where to put our fingers (which is NOT the point of this music theory and ear-training website and series), there is a point at which it makes a lot of sense to use our eyes to guide our musical learning. It makes sense to visualize sounds whenever it helps us apply something we've processed and understood to the instrument.

There are three steps to really master playing guitar by ear:

1) Follow what's happening in the music
2) Process it into scale degrees
3) Apply it to the instrument

Playing by ear is actually a process that occurs largely before we touch our instrument. For example, the first step in the process happens primarily in our ears and in our understanding of what we're hearing. And the second step, processing it into scale degrees, is vital if we want to be able to translate the raw sound we are receiving into something concrete. And the third, our ability to apply it to our instrument, requires a familiarity with how our instrument works. When the instrument in our hands, we want to have already put in the work, knowing what we'll play before we play it.

Even if we aren't trying to play by ear, and we simply want to have a deeper grasp of how music works (theory) and use that on our instrument, we still need the last two steps: we need to understand scales and how to apply them to the instrument.

With piano, this has always been a simple task: lower pitches go to the left, higher pitches go to the right. Half-steps and whole-steps are easy to identify. But with the guitar, this becomes complicated due to there being four directions of melodic movement, which I break down extensively in this earlier post, "Fretboard Certainty."

To introduce the final step, I often assign my students this "application to the guitar" exercise. It's called "Scale Through Chords."

1) Choose a key with lots of open chords, like C Major.
2) Identify the I, ii, iii, IV, V, and vi chords (in this case, C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am).
3) In each chord, begin to play the scale of the chosen THROUGH the chord. Meaning, if the student is playing the I chord (the C Major chord) in the key of C Major, begin to play a C Major Scale THROUGH the C Major chord. In other words, play a C Major scale simultaneously while holding the C Major chord shape, strumming the entire chord with each subsequent scale degree.

It would look something like this:

1E 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-**0**-**1**-**3**
2B 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-**0**-**1**-**2**-1-1-1
3G 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-**0**-**2**-0-0-0-0-0-0
4D 2-2-2-2-2-2-**0**-**2**-**3**-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2
5A 3-3-3-**0**-**2**-**3**-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3
6E **0**-**1**-**3**-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x

   E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G (Note Names)
   3-4-5-6-7-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-2-3-4-5 (Scale Degrees)

And the student would play it in reverse as well, and repeat the process for the next chord, ii, or D Minor, then again with iii (Em), IV (F Major), V (G Major), and vi (Am), all with the C Major scale running through each chord. And when that challenge is done, they would move onto the key of G, and perhaps other keys with open chords.

I found a cool little tool, here, that helps visualize both the chord shape and the scale applied to the fretboard (although it does show the scale over the entire fretboard and might be a little overwhelming).

The point of this is to create a dynamic understanding of chords through a better understanding of how to apply sounds to the fretboard.

In plain language: chords and chord progressions on the guitar become alive--moving, changing--rather than remain static and boring. Suddenly, chords are not shapes in TAB form, but scale degrees with neighboring tones that can be borrowed for melodic riffs and technical purposes like hammer-ons, pull-offs that come from our own ears and minds rather than someone else we're copying.

Isn't that what we all want? To play by ear? To improvise and incorporate cool techniques?

We'll explore these subjects even more deeply in future videos. Be sure to check out the Melody Module when it launches to brush up on your musicianship!
