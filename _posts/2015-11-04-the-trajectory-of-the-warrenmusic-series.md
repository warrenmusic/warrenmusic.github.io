Wow, we're buzzing ahead, now three videos in. And today, the fourth episode is live!

Where does this series begin? How will the course content be structured? What about really strange, creative music? Will we talk about that?

In Episode 4, "[The Trajectory Of the WARRENMUSIC Series](https://youtu.be/IrrvfR2_AYU)," I walk you through a visual representation of what it will look like to come along for this musicianship ride...

The vision of WARRENMUSIC, through my covers and tutorials, chord charts, and now this website has been and always strives to be simple: to help people get more out of the music they love. This website represents the latest and greatest attempt, by providing an approach to music that helps connect the gap we all experience between the music we love and the music we make through **music theory**, and **ear-training**. In the near future, we hope to bring you an amazing _ear-training and theory app_ to help you develop your musicianship like never before.

And in [the WARRENMUSIC Blog](http://warrenlain.com/blog/), it'll be similar. I'll be posting useful resources I find for the benefit of your ear and your insight.

All the best,
Warren
