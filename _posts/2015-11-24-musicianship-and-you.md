I've been talking a lot about myself up to this point. So let's talk about you.

Specifically, let's talk about your musical goals.

**Everyone** desires something from their musical journey.

Many of you want to write better songs, or improvise better, or gain more insight into the music you love, or play by ear.

Some of you simply want to be a better bandmate, and to be aware of what's going on during band practice.

And some of you want to create with more freedom, jumping from musical idea to musical idea, eliciting and expressing emotion sonically, with conviction and intensity.

Well, allow me to be very direct for a moment.

The truth is that **none of the above will happen** for you if you look to tabs, tutorials, and song-by-song private lessons.

It **won't even happen** for you if you understand some things about music, but don't have an ear for Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm to pick up on the things you're hearing in your favorite music.

It **definitely won't happen** if you have an ear for Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm, but lack the musical insight to process it all.

If any of the above describes you, **it simply WON'T happen for you**, unless you make a change.

The main problem with learning music today isn't that there aren't enough tabs, tutorials, or teachers. In fact, there are tons. And tons of great ones.

The problem is thinking that any of those can get you anywhere if all they do is teach you songs.

They can't.

Ask a tab to do more than teach you that one song. **It can't**.

Ask a tutorial to show you how to improvise the way the artist does, or play the song differently every time while retaining its essence the way the artist does, or how to make the song your own. Odds are, **it can't**.

Some teachers might LOVE it if you ask them the about real stuff... music theory, ear-training, how to think about and how to approach music the way musicians do. But you won't have unrestricted access to them. And fewer of this kind of teacher are very affordable.

Musicians who can play by ear, compose, improvise, write inspired songs, and find ways to continually grow do so by one thing: **investing in their musicianship.**

Perhaps it's time for you to try to invest in your own musicianship.

Perhaps it's time for you to

STOP looking OUT for help.

STOP expecting others to do it for you.

START looking within YOURSELF.

START developing YOUR ear, and YOUR understanding of music.

START building the bridge between the music you LOVE and the music you want to MAKE.

The way forward is MUSICIANSHIP.

The WARRENMUSIC Series will give you the tools you need to GROW your MUSICIANSHIP. To grow your own ear, and your own understanding of music.

Make the investment in yourself today.
