Episode 5 of The WARRENMUSIC Series is now live! It's titled, "[What Are You Hearing? (The Core Of a Song)](https://youtu.be/GWD5-xmSovo)."

This video asks the question that snaps everything into focus. Watch as I explain the difference between how casual listeners hear music, and how musicians listen to music, and talk about what three things lie at the musical core of a song.

There is so much going on in the music we love that it is easy to get overwhelmed by all the details. No wonder so many of us turn to tabs, tutorials, and other forms of pre-packaged music information to sort it all out for us. But the problem of outsourcing listening and thinking about music for ourselves is clear: we become dependent on something outside of us, and we rarely connect with anything beyond the single song or musical passage the tab or tutorial is teaching us. But fear not: **when we learn about and listen to the Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm of a song, we gain the essentials** that translate directly to music making.
