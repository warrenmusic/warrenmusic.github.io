Episode 3, titled “The Power Of Musicianship,” [is now live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KilQdtSAVBk).

What does **musicianship** actually look like?

**Musicianship** is the difference between just regurgitating someone else's pre-packaged instructions and making the music you love your own. It's the difference between just following a tab or a tutorial and using your own ear and musical insight. It's the difference between faking it and thinking/behaving the way musicians do.

In this video, I take you through a few examples of what **musicianship** looks like in the real world. My hope is that you'll be inspired to go beyond tabs and tutorials, and seek out, no, DEMAND a more substantial connection between the music you love and the music you want to make.

See what musicianship can do for you! And while you're at it, catch a snippet of *a previously unreleased song* from my forthcoming album...
