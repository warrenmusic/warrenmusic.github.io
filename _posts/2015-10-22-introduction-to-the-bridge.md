If you recall [our first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wAux1hh9wU), we talked about the GAP that exists between the music we love, and the music we make. This video speaks to the BRIDGE between those two things: Music Theory, and Ear-Training.

Quickly defined, Music Theory is a language that describes the connections, patterns, ideas, and larger concepts in music across songs, albums, artists, and genres. And Ear-Training is pretty self-explanatory: it's getting our ear to the place where we can identify what's going on in the music we love.

When we combine the two, there is an explosion we call musicianship!

Stay tuned. We'll see exactly what MUSICIANSHIP can do for you.
