If you recall Episode 6, which was first published back in July, it introduces what I call "The Sidewalk Test."

The Sidewalk Test is **two simple things**:

1) Identify the melody, harmony, and rhythm of a song without outside help
2) Reproduce it ON THE SPOT.

You pass the test if a stranger who knows the song is walking down the street would recognize it as they pass by.

Would you pass the test?

If not, then today you can do something about it. You can invest in your own musicianship.

Watch this blog for your opportunity to pre-order, which will drop **very soon**.

And until then, watch [a new cut of Episode 6](), now live.
